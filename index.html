            object-oriented programming language that is designed to have
             as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming

              are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM)

    <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">Education is a purposeful activity directed at achieving certain aims, such as transmitting knowledge or
         fostering skills and character traits. These aims may include the development of understanding, rationality, kindness, and honesty.
          Various researchers emphasize the role of critical thinking in order to distinguish education from indoctrination. Some theorists 
          require that education results in an improvement of the student while others prefer a value-neutral definition of the term. In a 
          slightly different sense, education may also refer, not to the process, but to the product of this process: the mental states and 
          dispositions possessed by educated people. Education originated as the transmission of cultural heritage from one generation to the next.
           Today, educational goals increasingly encompass new ideas such as the liberation of learners,
         skills needed for modern society, empathy, and complex vocational skills.</p>
